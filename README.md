They say media is a direct reflection of society.

But let's try to reverse the roles.

Why don't we use social media to influence sustainable practices?

### Weekly Sustainable Challenges
Every week there will be a new challenge that the members of social media to do something sustainable for the planet. 
This includes:
* Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
* Modes of transportation
* And other sustainable practices

**The GOAL**

To make being a good person, a consistent practice rather than a one-time thing. Becoming a sustainable person is something that takes time. Everytime you win a challenege it saves on to your profile along with impressions and interactions. All parts of things that make social media engaging but this supporting a good cause.
